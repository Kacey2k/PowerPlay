# PowerPlay (In Development)

**PowerPlay** is a multi-data utility for *TeamFortress 2*. 

It will capture and analyze in-game data—including players, maps, servers, messages, and other objects—storing their information in a client-side database for real-time insight and post-game analysis.

### Planned features:

- **Live Player Table:** View all players currently connected to your lobby. The table will include a user-assigned rating, unique SteamID, Username, number of encounters, kill counter, user-assigned attributes, user-assigned note, and time connected for each player.
- **Attributes Manager:** Easily create and manage colored attributes to more easily identify players you encounter in-game. An attribute is essentially a tag you apply to a player such as "Friend", "Cheater", "XYZ Clan Member", etc.
- **Live Killfeed Tab:** This tab will allow you to analyze all kills, and manage the players involved for each. The killer, weapon involved, victim, attributes the killer possesses, and whether it was a crit or not will be displayed.
- **Server / Map Tabs:** These tabs will document every map & server the program observes. Each unique map engine name (eg. koth_harvest_final) will generate a new map with statistics linked to it, and each unique server IP observed will generate a new server with stats tied to it + the ability to attempt connecting to the server directly.
- **User Stats:** The purpose of the utility is to track and explore data from your gameplay, so the user tab will be comprised of various stats from lifetime kills, average K/D, best maps, best servers, session time, etc..
- **TFMail:** Find yourself tabbed out of TF2 at times, but do not want to miss specific messages? You may find this module useful. TFMail simply notifies the user anytime specific chat messages are observed. It will also be able to be set to alert the user for all-messages, or specific types of messages (like map changes or players connecting to the server). Notably, the user will be able to set custom strings for the module to alert them of and receive notifications over desktop for each. The tab will include information on the sender (if applicable), time, string triggered, and of course the full message that was sent, as if it were an email inbox.
- **Party Chat Commands:** This compromise will allow the user to continue using the application while in-game to preform tasks such as marking players, recieving notifications, and various other utilities.
- **Tentative Features:** Some tentative/experimental features that may/may-not be deployed include: API access for more detailed Player tables, Rocket Jumping assistance module, GUI RCON Terminal, Themes, hover stats for players, Discord rich-presence, Language selection, and more.
